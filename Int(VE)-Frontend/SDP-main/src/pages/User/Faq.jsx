        <AccordionContent className="mt-2  text-[1.2rem]  text-customGreen font-sans">
        The amount of life insurance coverage you need depends on several factors, including your income, debts, lifestyle, and future financial goals. A common rule of thumb is to have coverage that is 10-12 times your annual income. However, it’s best to consult with a financial advisor to determine the appropriate coverage for your specific situation.

        <AccordionContent className="mt-2  text-[1.2rem]  text-customGreen font-sans">
        If you miss a premium payment, we offer a grace period, typically 30 days, during which you can make the payment without losing coverage. If you fail to pay within the grace period, the policy may lapse, meaning you lose your coverage. However, some policies may allow reinstatement within a certain timeframe, often requiring payment of past due premiums and proof of insurability.

        <AccordionTrigger className="text-lg font-semibold"> What is the difference between term life and whole life insurance?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent className="mt-2  text-[1.2rem]  text-customGreen font-sans">
        Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period, such as 10, 20, or 30 years, and pays a death benefit if the insured person dies within that term. It has no cash value and is generally more affordable. Whole life insurance, on the other hand, offers lifelong coverage and includes a savings component that accumulates cash value over time. It is more expensive due to the cash value feature and permanent coverage.

        <AccordionContent className="mt-2  text-[1.2rem]  text-customGreen font-sans">
        A nominee is the person or entity you designate to receive the death benefit from your life insurance policy. You can choose one or multiple nominees and allocate specific percentages of the benefit to each. Common beneficiaries include spouses, children, other family members, or charitable organizations. It’s important to review and update your beneficiary designations regularly to ensure they reflect your current wishes.

        <AccordionTrigger className="text-lg font-semibold">Can I have multiple life insurance policies?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent className="mt-2  text-[1rem]  text-customGreen font-sans">
        Yes, you can have multiple life insurance policies. Many people opt for this to cover different financial needs, such as a term policy to cover a mortgage and a whole life policy for lifelong protection and cash value accumulation. When applying for additional policies, insurers will consider your existing coverage and overall financial situation to determine eligibility and premiums.
